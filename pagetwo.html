  <h1> Bold & Italics </h1>
  <p>  This is a paragraph in my webpage. I am now going to add a link intot his page. How to do it? It will be through
  a ref hypertext link. We do this by addind a <a href="http://www.google.com" > google link </a> into this which will
  link it to another webpage directly from here. </p>
